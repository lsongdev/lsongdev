Hey there! üëã

Hi, I'm Liu Song, a full-stack developer with a passion for open-source software. I have experience in web and mobile development ([ios/macOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/id1702101282) / [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=6582472484007517384)), as well as a background in embedded systems and network protocols. I enjoy writing tech [blogs](https://lsong.org/posts) and developing [applications](https://lsong.org/apps.html) in my spare time. Proficient in Node.js, Golang, and server operations, I'm always eager to learn more and contribute to the community. Check out my GitHub [@lsongdev](https://github.com/lsongdev) for some of my projects and feel free to connect with me to discuss ideas. When I'm not coding, I enjoy listening to [music](https://lsong.org/music) and playing [games](https://lsong.org/games).

You can find somethings I am working on, take a walk and see if there's anything of your interest.

I want share my thoughts and experience with you! ü•≥
